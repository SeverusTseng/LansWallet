# LansWallet

Build an  iOS App with swift named LansWallet. Itâ€™s a crypto currency wallet, which contains 3 parts: login, wallet, and transaction.

For the login part, LansWallet uses the phone number authentication. It will take a phone number from the user and send a verification code to this phone number by text message. Then it asks the user to enter the code and verify user's identity.

For the wallet part, LansWallet displays the wallet, which has a table of accounts and the information of each account.

For the transaction part, LansWallet allows the user to make transactions between the accounts in the wallet.
